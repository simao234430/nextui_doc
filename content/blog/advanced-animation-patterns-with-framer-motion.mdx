I got **✨a lot✨** of positive feedback from my [Guide to creating animations that spark joy with Framer Motion](/posts/guide-animations-spark-joy-framer-motion/), and it's undeniable that this library has piqued many developers' interests in the world of web-based animations.

While I introduced in this previous post many of the foundational pieces that compose an animation, and how one can orchestrate multiple transitions very easily with Framer Motion, **I did not touch upon many of the more advanced features that this library provides**.

Ever wondered how to propagate animations throughout several components or to orchestrate complex layout transitions? Well, this article will tell you all about these advanced patterns and show you some of the great things one can accomplish with Framer Motion!

```jsx {2-9,13,17} title=Example of propagation pattern with Framer Motion
const CardWithGlow = () => {
  const glowVariants = {
    initial: {
      opacity: 0
    },
    hover: {
      opacity: 1
    }
  }

  return (
    // Parent sets the initial and whileHover variant keys
    <motion.div initial="initial" whileHover="hover">
      {/* child motion component sets variants that match the keys set by the parent to animate accordingly */}
      <motion.div variants={glowVariants} className="glow"/>
      <Card>
        <div>Some text on the card/div>
      </Card>
    </motion.div>
  )
}
```

You can check out the full code of a similar example by navigating to the [Card with glow effect on hover snippet](/snippets/2020-12-26-cardwithgloweffectonhover/) page.

Now let's apply what we learned about the propagation mechanism of Framer Motion! In the playground below you'll find a motion component with a "hover" animation. When hovering it, a little icon will show up on the right end side of that component. You can try to:

- **Modify the variant key** used in the motion component wrapping the button and see that now that it defers from what's being set by the parent component, the animation does not trigger and the button is not visible on hover.
- **Set an**`animate` **prop on the motion component that wraps the button** and see that it now animates on its own and does not consume the variant set by the parent on hover.

## Animate components when they are unmounting

So far, we've only seen examples of animation being triggered either on mount or following some specific events like hover or tap. But **what about triggering an animation right before a component unmounts?** Some sort of "exit" transition?

Well, in this second part, we'll take a look at the Framer Motion feature that addresses this use case and also the one that impressed me the most: `AnimatePresence`!

I tried to implement some kind of exit animations before learning about `AnimatePresence`, but it was hacky and always required extra code to set a proper "transitional" state (like `isClosing`, `isOpening`) and toggle the corresponding animation of that state. As you can imagine, it was very error-prone.
